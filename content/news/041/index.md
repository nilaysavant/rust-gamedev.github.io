Welcome to the 41st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Temple Knight]

_Shooting automatons in Temple Knight_

Temple Knight ([Itch.io] [Twitter]) by [@nilaysavant]
is a 3D FPS game developed using [Bevy].
You play the role of a knight and protect the temple from raiding automatons.

What began as an experiment to learn game dev in Rust using [Bevy].
Initially motivated by the visual appeal of a [scene running in the browser via WASM].
It quickly started taking the shape of a game:

- From adding [Rapierüó°Ô∏è] for [basic physics] to developing mechanics for other entities.
- Path finding for Automaton's using [control systems].
- Which was later switched to a deterministic [A-start navmesh approach].
- Developed mechanics for the player controller including the first-person-camera.
- Implemented weapon + projectiles systems.
- Finally [custom shaders for projectiles] were added as a finishing touch.

An experiment that became the first game published by [@nilaysavant].
Play [Temple Knight] in your browser.
